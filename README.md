01.	DRAWING:
This prompt in particular, I wanted to keep incredibly simple just to solidify my skills in p5.js as this was the project i completed first. This included making sure I understood what each of the functions meant, how to add colour and shapes. Although it is simple and is a direct representation of the breif, i did enjoy making this as it set me up well to do the project that i completed next, movement.

02. Movement:
   The code i created for this prompt was inpired by the work i do outside of university. It was developed based off a collague, whos work is primarily in sustainability and food wastage. I was approached with the idea of creating a food waste moving image aimed at children to teach them about the importance of not wasting food but keeping it lighthearted for the younger audience. The prompt is a start of this project. I am not a very confident coder, so i found this very challenging, but i wanted to challenge myself. Thid did require alot of research to complete it. Whilst doing this project it did make me feel very confident with coding and the elements within the code, although it was tricky.
[03.Multiples](03.muliples/index.html)
   For this task, i used a canvas which was not the full size of the screen to try something different from the rest of my project. I did find this one the harest out of the project, as i found the different elements moving confused me more than static. I did take alot of the knowledge for this one from the last prompt, movement. I personally really liked the outcome, it was the most interactive of my tasks and i would like to explore these concepts further.
[04. Media](04.media/index.html)
    The Media prompt inspired me to add some media from my gap year. I used a collage of photos that i had taken from my summer trip across Europe and North Africa. I found this prompt very straight forward until i loaded it onto the live server where it had compresssed my image and this confused me. I researched on youtube how to decompress the image and it resized it. My most useful tool was researching to complete this assessment brief.
